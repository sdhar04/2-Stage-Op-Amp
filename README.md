## Overview
I designed a two-stage Operational Amplifier with Miller Frequency Compensation to enhance stability and ensure reliable performance across a wide range of frequencies. The amplifier achieves a high gain and a broad unity-gain bandwidth (UGB), making it suitable for various analog signal processing applications. The design process included a detailed analysis of poles and phase margin to ensure stability.

## Task
To design a two-stage Operational Amplifier with Miller Frequency Compensation, targeting a high gain and ensuring stability.

## Skills
Analog Electronics, LTSpice

## Approach
+ **Design the Amplifier Stages:** Design the first stage for high gain and the second stage for high output swing.
+ **Miller Frequency Compensation:** Implement Miller frequency compensation to stabilize the amplifier.
+ **Pole and Phase Margin Analysis:** Perform a detailed pole analysis and set the phase margin to 60 degrees to ensure stability.
+ **Achieve Target Specifications:** Aim for a gain of 90 dB and a unity-gain bandwidth (UGB) of 30 MHz to meet performance requirements.
This design ensures that the operational amplifier provides robust performance, high signal amplification, and stability across a broad frequency range.
